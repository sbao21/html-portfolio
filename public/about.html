<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Shaohang, you can call me Shao! I am a rising Junior at Queens College studying Computer Science. I've served 5 years in the Marines as a radio technician and decided to attend school afterwards. I like to lift weights, watch anime, play games and collect Transformers. I am motivated to learn and study computer science as it provides a flexible career path that keeps me interested!</p>

<p>I'm still trying to familiarize myself with the fields of Computer Science, short term goals are to learn front end web-development over this summer. Eventually I want to learn AI and machine learning to integrate them into useful applications. I don't have much experience in Computer Science up till now, most of it is learning C++ and Java. I'm hoping to learn alot this summer through the Tech Incubator and studying on my own time.</p>

<p>I served in the Marines as a radio technician and held multiple billets facilitating daily operations. My job includes troubleshooting and repairing different communication systems in addition to coordinating with external elements to complete the mission.</p>
